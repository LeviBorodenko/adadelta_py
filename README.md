# adadelta_py
Clean & dependency-free implementation of the ADADELTA
algorithm as presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5701.pdf)

## basic usage
Just create gradient function that takes a vector (list)
and outputs the gradient vector (again, a list) and 
provide an initial guess. 

## advanced usage
Check out the docstring to see all the other parameters
that can be tweaked and further details.

Enjoy.
